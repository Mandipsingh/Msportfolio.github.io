        <h2>A.Facts About The Indian Armed Forces That’ll Make You Respect Them Even More</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="introduction10">

        <br>
        <h3>1. India controls the highest battlefield in the world, the Siachen glacier, at 5000 metres above Mean Sea Level (MSL).</h3>
        <img src="images/achive1.JPG" height="300" width="300" alt="achivement1">

        <br><br>
        <h3>2. India has the biggest "voluntary" army in the world.</h3>
        <img src="images/achive2.jpg" height="300" width="300" alt="achivement2">
        <br>All serving and reserve personnel have actually “opted” for service. There is a provision for conscription (forced recruitment) in the constitution, but it has never been used.<br>

        <br>
        <h3>3. Indian soldiers are considered among the very best in high altitude and mountain warfare.</h3>
        <img src="images/achive3.jpg" height="300" width="300" alt="achivement3">
        <br>The Indian army’s High Altitude Warfare School (HAWS) is one of the most elite military training centers in the world and is frequented by Special Ops teams from the U.S, U.K & Russia. U.S Special Forces trained at HAWS before their deployment during the invasion of Afghanistan<br>

        <br>
        <h3>4. India covertly tested its nuclear arsenal in the early 1970s and late 1990s without the CIA even knowing what was happening.</h3>
        <img src="images/achive4.jpeg" height="300" width="300" alt="achivement4">
        <br>Till date, it is considered to be one of the CIA’s biggest failures in espionage and detection.<br>

        <br>
        <h3>5. Unlike other government organisations and institutions in India, there are no provisions for reservations based on caste or religion.</h3>
        <img src="images/achive5.jpg" height="300" width="300" alt="achivement5">
        <br>Soldiers are recruited based on their overall merit and fitness based on stringent tests and trials. And once a citizen of India joins the forces, he/she becomes a soldier. Nothing else. Nothing more<br>

        <br>
        <h3>6. In the Battle of Longewala, on which the famous Bollywood movie “Border” is based, there were only two casualties on the Indian side.</h3>

        <br>

        <br>
        <h3>12. The Military Engineering Services (MES) is one of the biggest construction agencies in India.</h3>
        <img src="images/achive12.jpg" height="300" width="300" alt="achivement12">
        <br>The MES and Border Roads Organisation (BRO) are together responsible for the construction and maintenance of some of the most awesome roads and bridges ever to have been built.

        <br>
        <h3>13. The Indo Pakistan War of 1971 came to end with the surrender of about 93,000 combatants and officials of the Pakistani Army.</h3>

        <h3>14. The Missiles</h3>
        <img src="images/Missile.jpg" height="300" width="300" alt="achivement14">
        <br>India’s Agni-V missile can cover the range of 8,000 km in any direction with the speed exceeding that of the bullet. The missile can carry 1.1 tonne of nuclear warhead over 5,000 km. The accuracy of it reaches the target within a few meters of precision. This missile alone is the perfect tool for answering any weaponry threat to the country. Another set of Indian missiles, Prithvi missiles are best known their short range, precision, carrying nuclear warhead and for emergency use.
